# GWORDLE game  
GWORDLE was created for my daughter, who likes Wordle but dislikes having to wait a whole day for a new puzzle.  

## Goals  
* Give my daughter what she wants  
* Teach some basics of the underlying mechanics that make the web work (html, css, js)
* Single-file application.  

## Compromises  
I compromised on the single file goal when I added Google Fonts.  I deemed this as acceptable since
1. The file is not local
2. If the font doesn't load then a local fallback font is used
3. My daughter wanted a better font
